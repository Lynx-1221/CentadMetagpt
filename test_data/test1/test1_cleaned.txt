Scenario: A company has 8 office clusters (nodes) that run different parts of a distributed application. Pairs of clusters communicate with known average bandwidth demand (edge weights, in Mbps). Each cluster also has a processing-capacity rating (node value, in arbitrary processing units). The IT team wants to split the 8 clusters into two groups (Group X and Group Y) so that cross-group communication is maximized — i.e.,
    the sum of bandwidth of links that go between the groups is as large as possible (a weighted max-cut). 
    Because latency-sensitive tasks should remain balanced across the two sites,
    the total processing capacity in the two groups should not differ by more than 10 units.
Nodes (cluster name — processing capacity):
Alpha — 18
Beta — 12
Gamma — 15
Delta — 10
Epsilon — 14
Zeta — 9
Eta — 13
Theta — 11
Edges (unordered pair — bandwidth demand in Mbps):
(Alpha, Beta) — 30
(Alpha, Gamma) — 20
(Alpha, Delta) — 5
(Alpha, Epsilon) — 12
(Beta, Gamma) — 25
(Beta, Delta) — 8
(Beta, Zeta) — 10
(Gamma, Epsilon) — 18
(Gamma, Eta) — 7
(Delta, Zeta) — 22
(Epsilon, Zeta) — 6
(Epsilon, Theta) — 14
(Zeta, Eta) — 11
(Eta, Theta) — 9
(Delta, Theta) — 4
(Any pair not listed has bandwidth demand 0.)

Department Interaction Audit – Q2 to Q4 Observations  
(Employees: 100 total across Engineering, Product, Analytics, and Infrastructure)

Below is a collection of notes, incident logs, peer feedback snippets, and manager summaries describing interpersonal collaboration or friction between employees. Some relationships are positive, some negative, and many mixed or contextual.

General Notes:
The CTO wants to reorganize the entire technical division into two large sub-teams to reduce systematic friction, improve workflow alignment, and minimize repeated conflict cycles. This document contains qualitative data collected from meetings, retrospectives, ticket histories, and HR reports.

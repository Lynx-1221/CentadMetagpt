Over the past six months, there have been several interpersonal issues within the Software Engineering Department. Employee interaction patterns observed through incident reports, peer reviews, and manager notes indicate strong cases of friction and collaboration that are affecting productivity.

- Alex and Jordan have been involved in multiple disagreements about code ownership and responsibilities. Jordan claims Alex commits changes without consulting the team, which Alex disputes.
- Priya has difficulty working with Jordan, stating that Jordan often delays approvals and blocks progress unnecessarily. Priya and Alex, however, collaborate effectively and deliver features consistently ahead of schedule.
- Ethan used to work closely with Alex and Priya, but since the reorganization in May, Ethan has been paired with Jordan and Sam. Since then, Ethan has logged several complaints about poor communication and conflicting priorities.
- Sam is generally neutral but seems to work best with Jordan, as reflected in sprint retrospectives that mention “aligned goals” and “efficient problem-solving.” On the other hand, Sam and Priya tend to have differences in coding standards and documentation expectations.
- In one 360-degree feedback round, Priya and Ethan both highlighted that working together has been smooth historically, especially on front-end modules.
- Alex and Sam rarely interact directly and have no notable conflict or standout collaboration.
- Additionally, there are two employees, Kelly and Miguel, who joined the department in June. They are both new and have not yet formed many working relationships. However, Miguel worked with Priya on a FastAPI middleware feature and the feedback was positive.
- In the same sprint, Alex pointed out that Kelly missed a critical deployment window. Kelly responded later that Alex had not communicated deployment expectations, leading to some friction.
- Jordan expressed that Sam is dependable and “always meets timelines,” whereas Alex and Priya were described as “hard to synchronize with due to differing technical approaches.”
- In the annual performance conversation, Ethan reported that aligning schedules with Sam and Jordan is exhausting and “takes more time than writing the code itself,” indicating strong workflow misalignment.

Objectives:
Management wants to reorganize the team into TWO smaller sub-teams in a way that:
- Minimizes friction and communication breakdowns.
- Keeps well-functioning collaborators together where possible.
- Reduces overhead caused by clashing personalities and work styles.

The department must be split into exactly two groups. All employees must be assigned to one team or the other. Management is open to a data-driven partitioning model as long as it explains the logic behind the grouping.

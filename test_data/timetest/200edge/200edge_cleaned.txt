A large hospital is undergoing an internal reorganization.
It wants to split its departments into two operational divisions.
However, many departments experience coordination friction due to:
Shared equipment
Conflicting clinical workflows
Data access bottlenecks
Administrative and policy disagreements
Each pairwise friction has a severity level.
The hospital wants to partition departments such that the total friction across the two divisions is maximized.

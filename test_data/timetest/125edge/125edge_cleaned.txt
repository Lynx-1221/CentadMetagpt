A technology company has 20 internal teams.
Due to overlapping responsibilities, tooling conflicts, and competing priorities, pairs of teams experience friction when collaborating.
Management wants to split the teams into two divisions such that the total friction between teams placed in different divisions is maximized.

The number is the friction level between the teams

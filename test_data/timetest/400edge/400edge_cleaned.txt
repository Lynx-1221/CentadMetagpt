A large university operates a multidisciplinary research consortium consisting of 30 research labs, centers, and departments.
Due to:
Competition for grants and funding
Overlapping research domains
Data ownership and IP disputes
Shared infrastructure constraints
many pairs of research units experience collaboration friction.
University leadership wants to divide the units into two strategic consortia such that the total friction between the two groups is maximized.
